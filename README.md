Hi, my name is Tyler Oakley and I am an intern at Briebug Software.
I attended the University of Colorado Colorado Springs studying Computer Science.
I have experience writing programs in Java, C, C++, Python, and I can't wait to learn
about Angular! In my free time, I like to play the drums, inline hockey, and video games
such as Escape From Tarkov and Overwatch.
